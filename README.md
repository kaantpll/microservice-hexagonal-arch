# Food Ordering System

## Project Description
This project involves the implementation of **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** and **Hexagonal Architecture** principles using **Spring Boot**. Technologies used in this project include **Java**, **Docker**, and **PostgreSQL**.
##
In this project, the Hexagonal Architecture & DDD udemy course by Ali Gelenler was followed.

## Objectives
- Manage complex business rules and processes with Domain-Driven Design (DDD)
- Create a modular and testable structure using Hexagonal Architecture
- Develop a performant and scalable application using modern technologies

## Technologies Used
- **Spring Boot**: A modern application development framework based on Java
- **Java**: The primary programming language
- **Docker**: For containerizing and deploying the application
- **PostgreSQL**: The database management system

## Project Structure
The project is structured following Hexagonal Architecture principles, ensuring separation of concerns and promoting modularity. The main components include:

### Domain Layer
- Core business logic and rules
- Entities, Value Objects, and Aggregates

### Application Layer
- Application services coordinating domain logic
- Data Transfer Objects (DTOs)

### Infrastructure Layer
- Persistence using Kafka
- Docker configuration for containerization
- Integration with external services

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Java 17
- Docker
- PostgreSQL
